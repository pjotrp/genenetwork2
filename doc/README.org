* Introduction

Large system deployments can get very [[http://biogems.info/contrib/genenetwork/gn2.svg ][complex]]. In this document we
explain the GeneNetwork version 2 (GN2) reproducible deployment system
which is based on GNU Guix (see also [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/README.md][Guix-notes]]). The Guix
system can be used to install GN with all its files and dependencies.

The official installation path is from a checked out version of the
main Guix package tree and that of the Genenetwork package
tree. Current supported versions can be found as the SHA values of
'gn-latest' branches of [[https://gitlab.com/genenetwork/guix-bioinformatics][Guix bioinformatics]] and [[https://gitlab.com/genenetwork/guix][GNU Guix]].

For a full view of runtime dependencies as defined by GNU Guix, see
an example of the [[#gn2-dependency-graph][GN2 Dependency Graph]].

* Install

The quickest way to install GN2 is by using a binary installation
(tarball or Docker image).  These installations are bundled by GNU
Guix and include all dependencies. You can install GeneNetwork on most
Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and CentOS,
provided you have administrator privileges (root). The alternative is
a Docker installation.

** Tarball

Download the ~800Mb tarball from
[[http://files.genenetwork.org/software/binary_tarball/]]. Validate the checksum and
unpack to root, for example

: tar xvzf genenetwork2-2.10rc3-1538ffd-tarball-pack.tar.gz
: mv /gnu /
: mv /opt/genenetwork2 /opt/

Now you shoud be able to start the server with

: /opt/genenetwork2/bin/genenetwork2

When the server stops with a MySQL error [[#run-mysql-server][Run MySQL server]]
and set SQL_URI to point at it. For example:

: export SQL_URI=mysql://gn2:mysql_password@127.0.0.1/db_webqtl_s

See also [[#mysql-cant-connect-server-through-socket-error][Mysql can't connect server through socket ERROR]].

** Docker

Docker images are also available through
[[http://files.genenetwork.org/software/]]. Validate the checksum and run
with [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/][Docker load]].

** With source

For more elaborate installation instructions on deploying GeneNetwork from
source see [[#source-deployment][Source deployment]].

* Running GN2

Default settings for GN2 are listed in a file called
[[../etc/default_settings.py][default_settings.py]]. You can copy this file and pass it as a new
parameter to the genenetwork2 command, e.g.

: genenetwork2 mysettings.py

or you can set environment variables to override individual parameters, e.g.

: env SERVER_PORT=5004 SQL_URI=mysql://user:pwd@dbhostname/db_webqtl genenetwork2

the debug and logging switches can be particularly useful when
developing GN2.

* Run MySQL server
** Install MySQL with GNU GUIx

These are the steps you can take to install a fresh installation of
mysql (which comes as part of the GNU Guix genenetwork2 install).

As root configure and run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
adduser mysql && addgroup mysql
mysqld --datadir=/var/mysql --initialize-insecure
mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld
chown mysql.mysql ~/mysql /var/run/mysqld
mysqld -u mysql --datadir=/var/mysql --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp -P 12048"
#+END_SRC

If you want to run as root you may have to set

: /etc/my.cnf
: [mysqld]
: user=root

To check error output in a file on start-up run with something like

: mysqld -u mysql --console  --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp  --datadir=/gnu/mysql --log-error=~/test.log

Other tips are that Guix installs mysqld in your profile, so this may work

: /home/user/.guix-profile/bin/mysqld -u mysql --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp  --datadir=/gnu/mysql

When you get errors like:

: qlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (_mysql_exceptions.IntegrityError) (1215, 'Cannot add foreign key constraint')

you may need to set

: set foreign_key_checks=0

** Load the small database in MySQL

At this point we require the underlying distribution to install and
run mysqld (see next section for GNU Guix). Currently we have two databases for deployment,
'db_webqtl_s' is the small testing database containing experiments
from BXD mice and 'db_webqtl_plant' which contains all plant related
material.

Download one database from

[[http://files.genenetwork.org/raw_database/]]

[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/genenetwork2/db_webqtl_s.zip]]

Check the md5sum.

After installation inflate the database binary in the MySQL directory

: cd ~/mysql
: chown -R mysql:mysql db_webqtl_s/
: chmod 700 db_webqtl_s/
: chmod 660 db_webqtl_s/*

restart MySQL service (mysqld). Login as root

: myslq -u root

and

: mysql> show databases;
: +--------------------+
: | Database           |
: +--------------------+
: | information_schema |
: | db_webqtl_s        |
: | mysql              |
: | performance_schema |
: +--------------------+

Set permissions and match password in your settings file below:

: mysql> grant all privileges on db_webqtl_s.* to gn2@"localhost" identified by 'mysql_password';

You may need to change "localhost" to whatever domain you are
connecting from (mysql will give an error).

Note that if the mysql connection is not working, try connecting to
the IP address and check server firewall, hosts.allow and mysql IP
configuration (see below).

Note for the plant database you can rename it to db_webqtl_s, or
change the settings in etc/default_settings.py to match your path.

* Working with the GN2 source code

See [[development.org]].

* Running ElasticSearch

In order to start up elasticsearch:
Penguin - change user to "elasticsearch" and use the following command: "env JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk-9.0.4 /opt/elasticsearch-6.2.1/bin/elasticsearch"


** SystemD

New server - as root run "systemctl restart elasticsearch"

#+BEGIN_SRC
tux01:/etc/systemd/system# cat elasticsearch.service
[Unit]
Description=Run Elasticsearch

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/elasticsearch-6.2.1/bin/elasticsearch
Environment=JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk-9.0.4

[[Architecture.org]].  The rest of this document is mostly on deployment
of GN2.

* Trouble shooting

** ImportError: No module named jinja2

If you have all the Guix packages installed this error points out that
the environment variables are not set. Copy-paste the paths into your
terminal (mainly so PYTHON_PATH and R_LIBS_SITE are set) from the
information given by guix:

: guix package --search-paths

On one system:

: export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/python2.7/site-packages"
: export R_LIBS_SITE="$HOME/.guix-profile/site-library/"
: export GEM_PATH="$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0"

and perhaps a few more.
** ERROR: 'can not find directory $HOME/gn2_data' or 'can not find directory $HOME/genotype_files/genotype'

The default settings file looks in your $HOME/gn2_data. Since these
files come with a Guix installation you should take a hint from the
values in the installed version of default_settings.py (see above in
this document).

You can use the GENENETWORK_FILES switch to set the datadir, for example

: env GN2_PROFILE=~/opt/gn-latest GENENETWORK_FILES=/gnu/data/gn2_data ./bin/genenetwork2

** Can't run a module

In rare cases, development modules are not brought in with Guix
because no source code is available. This can lead to missing modules
on a running server. Please check with the authors when a module
is missing.
** Rpy2 error 'show' now found

This error

: __show = rpy2.rinterface.baseenv.get("show")
: LookupError: 'show' not found

means that R was updated in your path, and that Rpy2 needs to be
recompiled against this R - don't you love informative messages?

In our case it means that GN's PYTHONPATH is not in sync with
R_LIBS_SITE. Please check your GNU Guix GN2 installation paths,
you man need to reinstall. Note that this may be the point you
may want to start using profiles (see profile section).

** Mysql can't connect server through socket ERROR

The following error

: sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (2002, 'Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\' (2 "No such file or directory")')

means that MySQL is trying to connect locally to a non-existent MySQL
server, something you may see in a container. Typically replicated with something like

: mysql -h localhost

try to connect over the network interface instead, e.g.

: mysql -h 127.0.0.1

if that works run genenetwork after setting SQL_URI to something like

: export SQL_URI=mysql://gn2:mysql_password@127.0.0.1/db_webqtl_s


* IRC session

Here an IRC session where we installed GN2 from scratch using GNU Guix
and a download of the test database.

#+begin_src
<pjotrp> time to get binary install sorted :)  [07:03]
<pjotrp> Guix is designed for distributed installation servers
<pjotrp> we have one on guix.genenetwork.org
<pjotrp> it contains all the prebuild packages
<pjotrp> for GN
<user01> okay  [07:04]
<pjotrp> let's step back however  [07:05]
<pjotrp> I presume the environment is set with all guix package --search-paths
<pjotrp> right?
<user01> yep
<user01> set to the ones in ~/.guix-profile/
<pjotrp> good, and you are in gn-deploy-guix repo  [07:06]
<user01> yep  [07:07]
<pjotrp> git log shows

Author: David Thompson <dthompson2@worcester.edu>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 21:20:19 2016 -0400

<user01> yes
<pjotrp> env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -A genenetwork2  [07:08]
<pjotrp> shows

genenetwork2    2.0-a8fcff4     out ../guix-bioinformatics/gn/packages/genenetwork.scm:144:2
genenetwork2-database-small     1.0     out ../guix-bioinformatics/gn/packages/genenetwork.scm:270:4
genenetwork2-files-small        1.0     out ../guix-bioinformatics/gn/packages/genenetwork.scm:228:4

<user01> yeah  [07:09]
<pjotrp> OK, we are in sync. This means we should be able to install the exact
         same software
<pjotrp> I need to start up my guix daemon - I usually run it in a screen
<pjotrp> screen -S guix-daemon
<user01> hah, I don't have screen installed yet  [07:11]
<pjotrp> comes with guix ;)  [07:12]
<pjotrp> no worries, you can run it any way you want
<pjotrp> $HOME/.guix-profile/bin/guix-daemon --build-users-group=guixbuild
<user01> then something's weird, because it says I don't have it
<pjotrp> oh, you need to install it first  [07:13]
<pjotrp> guix package -A screen
<pjotrp> screen  4.3.1   out     gnu/packages/screen.scm:34:2
<pjotrp> but you can skip this install, for now
<user01> alright  [07:14]
<pjotrp> env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -i genenetwork2 --dry-run
<pjotrp> substitute: updating list of substitutes from
         'https://mirror.hydra.gnu.org'...  79.1%
<pjotrp> you see that?
<pjotrp> followed by  [07:15]
substitute: updating list of substitutes from
'https://hydra.gnu.org'... 100.0%
The following derivations would be built:
   /gnu/store/rk7nw0rjqqsha958m649wrykadx6mmhl-profile.drv

/gnu/store/7b0qjybvfx8syzvfs7p5rdablwhbkbvs-module-import-compiled.drv
   /gnu/store/cy9zahbbf23d3cqyy404lk9f50z192kp-module-import.drv
   /gnu/store/ibdn603i8grf0jziy5gjsly34wx82lmk-gtk-icon-themes.drv

<pjotrp> which should have the same HASH values /gnu/store/7b0qjybvf... etc.
                                                                        [07:16]
<user01> profile has a different hash
<pjotrp> but the next ones?
<user01> they're the same
<pjotrp> not sure why profile differs. Do you see the contact with
         mirror.hydra.org?  [07:17]
<user01> yeah
<pjotrp> OK, that means you set the key correctly for that one :)
<pjotrp> alright we are at the same state now. You can see most packages need
         to be rebuild because they are no longer cached as binaries on hydra
                                                                        [07:18]
<pjotrp> things move fast...
<user01> hehe
<pjotrp> let me also do the same on my laptop - which I have staged before
                                                                        [07:19]
<pjotrp> btw, to set the path I often do  [07:20]
<pjotrp> export
         PATH="/home/wrk/.guix-profile/bin:/home/wrk/.guix-profile/sbin":$PATH
<pjotrp> to keep things like 'screen' from Debian
<pjotrp> Once past building guix itself that is normally OK  [07:21]
<user01> ah, okay
<user01> will do that
<pjotrp> the guix build requires certain versions of tools, so you don't want
         to mix foreign tools in  [07:23]
<user01> makes sense  [07:24]
<pjotrp> On my laptop I am trying the main updating list of substitutes from
         'http://hydra.gnu.org'...  10.5%  [07:27]
<pjotrp> it is a bit slow, but let's see if there is a difference with the
         mirror
<pjotrp> you can see there are two servers here. Actually with recent daemons,
         if the mirror fails it will try the main server  [07:28]
<pjotrp> I documented the use of a caching server here  [07:29]
<pjotrp> https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/REPRODUCIBLE.org
<pjotrp> this is exactly what we are doing now
<user01> alrighty  [07:35]
<pjotrp> To see if a remote server has a guix server running it should respond
                                                                        [07:36]
<pjotrp> lynx http://guix.genenetwork.org:8080 --dump
<pjotrp> Resource not found: /
<pjotrp>
<pjotrp> you see that?
<user01> yes  [07:37]
<pjotrp> good. The main hydra server is too slow. So on my laptop I forced
         using the mirror with  [07:38]
<pjotrp> env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics/ ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -i genenetwork2 --dry-run
         --substitute-urls="http://mirror.hydra.gnu.org"
<pjotrp>
<pjotrp> the list looks the same to me  [07:40]
<user01> me too
<pjotrp> note that some packages will be built and some downloaded, right?
                                                                        [07:41]
<user01> yes
<pjotrp> atlas is actually a binary on my system  [07:43]
<pjotrp> I mean in that list
<pjotrp> so, it should not build. Same as yours?
<user01> yeah, atlas and r-gtable are the ones to be downloaded
<pjotrp> You should not have seen that error ;)
<pjotrp> we should try and install it this way, try  [07:44]
<pjotrp>  env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -i genenetwork2 --cores=4 --max-jobs=4 --keep-going  [07:46]
<pjotrp> set CPUs and max-jobs to something sensible
<pjotrp> Does your VM have multiple cores?
<pjotrp> note you can always press Ctrl-C during install
<user01> it doesn't, I'll reboot it and give it another core  [07:47]
<user02> Hey  [07:48]
<user02> I'm here
<user02> Will be stepping away for some breakfast
<pjotrp> Can you do the same as us
<pjotrp> Can you see the irc log
<user02> Alright
<user02> Yes, I can
<user02> Please email me a copy in five minutes
<pjotrp> user01: so when I use the GN server  [07:56]
<pjotrp> env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -i genenetwork2 --dry-run
         --substitute-urls=http://guix.genenetwork.org:8080
<pjotrp> I don't need to build anything  [07:57]
<pjotrp> (this won't work for you, yet)
<pjotrp> to get it to work you need to 'trust' it   [07:58]
<pjotrp> but, first get the build going
<pjotrp> I'll have a coffee while you and get building
<user01> yeah it's doing its thing now  [08:01]
<pjotrp> cool  [08:02]
<pjotrp> in a separate terminal you can try and install with the gn mirror
                                                                        [08:05]
<pjotrp> I'll  send you the public key and you can paste it as said
         https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/REPRODUCIBLE.org
                                                                        [08:06]
<user01> alright
<pjotrp> should be in the E-mail  [08:09]
<pjotrp> getting it working it kinda nasty since the server gives no feedback
<pjotrp> it works when you see no more in the build list ;)  [08:11]
<pjotrp> btw, you can install software in parallel. Guix does that.
<pjotrp> even the same packages
<pjotrp> so keep building ;)
<pjotrp> try and do this with Debian...
<pjotrp> coffee for me  [08:12]
<user01> the first build failed                                                                        [08:15]
<pjotrp> OK, Dennis fixed that one yesterday  [08:27]
<pjotrp> the problem is that sometime source tarballs disappear  [08:28]
<pjotrp> R is notorious for that
<user01> haha, that's inconvenient..
<pjotrp> well, it is good that Guix catches them
<pjotrp> but we do not cache sources
<pjotrp> binaries are cached - to some degree - so we don't have to rebuild
         those  [08:29]
<pjotrp> time to use the guix cache at guix.genenetwork.org
<pjotrp> try and install the key (it is in the E-mail)
<pjotrp> and see what this lists  [08:31]
<pjotrp> env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -i genenetwork2
         --substitute-urls=http://guix.genenetwork.org --dry-run
<pjotrp> should be all binary installs
<user01> it's not..  [08:32]
<user01> if I remove --substitute-urls, the list changes, does that mean I
             have the key set up correctly at least?  [08:33]
<pjotrp> dunno  [08:35]
<pjotrp> how many packages does it want to build?
<pjotrp> should be zero
<user01> four
<pjotrp> Ah, that is OK - those are default profile things
<user01> genenetwork2 is among the ones to be downloaded so  [08:36]
<pjotrp> remove --dry-run
<pjotrp> yeah, good sign :)
<pjotrp> we'll still hit a snag, but run it
<pjotrp> should be fast
<user01> doing it  [08:37]
<user01> it worked!  [08:38]
<user01> I think  [08:39]
<pjotrp> heh  [08:40]
<pjotrp> you mean it is finished?
<user01> yep
<pjotrp> type genenetwork2
<user01> complains about not being able to connect to the database  [08:41]
<pjotrp> last snag :)
<pjotrp> no database
<pjotrp> well, we succeeded in installing a same-byte install of a very
         complex system :)  [08:42]
<pjotrp> (always take time to congratulate yourself)
<pjotrp> now we need to install mysql
<user01> hehe :)
<pjotrp> this can be done throug guix or through debian  [08:43]
<pjotrp> the latter is a bit easier here, so let's do that
<pjotrp> fun note: you can mix debian and guix
<pjotrp> Follow instructions on   [08:44]
<pjotrp>
         https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/tree/staging/doc#run-mysql-server
<pjotrp> apt-get install mysql-common  [08:45]
<pjotrp> may do it
<pjotrp> You can also install with guix, but I need to document that
<pjotrp> btw your internet must be fast :)  [08:46]
<user01> hehe it is ;)
<pjotrp> when the database is installed  [08:48]
<pjotrp> be sure to set the password as instructed  [08:50]
<pjotrp> when mysql is set the genenetwork2 command should fire up the web
         server on localhost:5003  [08:58]
<pjotrp> btw my internet is way slower :)  [09:00]
<user02> I'm back  [09:04]
<user02> fixed router firmware upgrade problem
<user02> unbricking
<pjotrp> tssk  [09:07]
<user02> I'll never leave routers to update themselves again  [09:08]
<user02> self-brick highway
<user02> Resuming  [09:09]
<pjotrp> auto-updates are evil
<pjotrp> always switch them off
<pjotrp> user02: can you install genenetwork like user has done?  [09:10]
<pjotrp> pretty well documented here now :)
<user02> Yes I can  [09:11]
<user02> Already installed key
<pjotrp> user02: you are getting binary packages only now?  [09:13]
<user02> That's the sanest way to go now
<user02> seriously
<pjotrp> everything should be pre-built from guix.genenetwork.org
<pjotrp> you are downloading?
<user02> yes  [09:15]
<pjotrp> cool. Maybe an idea to set up a server
<pjotrp> for your own use
<user02> Stuck at downloading preprocesscore
<pjotrp> should not  [09:24]
<pjotrp> what does env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics/
         ./pre-inst-env guix package -i genenetwork2
         --substitute-urls="http://guix.genenetwork.org" --dry-run
                                                                        [09:25]
<pjotrp> say for r-prepocesscore
<pjotrp> download or build?
<pjotrp> mine says download  [09:26]
<user02> it only lists the derivatives to be built
<user02> nothing else happens  [09:27]
<pjotrp> OK, so there is a problem
<pjotrp> your key may not be working
<pjotrp> everything should be listed as 'to be download'  [09:28]
<user02> Hmm
<user02> Ah
<user02> I know where I messed up
<pjotrp> where?
<user02> I did add the key
<user02> However
<pjotrp> (I am documenting)
<user02> I did not tell guix to trust it
<pjotrp> yes
<pjotrp> and there is another potential problem
<user02> Remember the documentation on installing guix?
<user02> You have to tell guix to trust the default key  [09:29]
<user02> Right?
<user02> So in this case
<pjotrp> read the IRC log
<user02> That step is mandatory
<pjotrp> user01: how are you doing?
<pjotrp> user02:
         https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/REPRODUCIBLE.org#using-gnu-guix-archive
                                                                        [09:30]
<user01> a little bit left on the db download
<pjotrp> user02: you should see no more building
<pjotrp> user02: another issue may be that you updated r-preprocesscore
         package in guix-buinformatics  [09:32]
<pjotrp> all downstream packages will want to rebuild
<user02> no, not really
<user02> It's not even installed
<pjotrp> checkout a branch of the the old version - make sure we are in synch
<pjotrp> should be at
         /gnu/store/y1f3r2xs3fhyadd46nd2aqbr2p9qv2ra-r-biocpreprocesscore-1.32.0
                                                                        [09:33]
<pjotrp>
<user03> pjotrp: Possibly we should use the archive utility of Guix to do
        deployment to avoid such out-of-sync differences :)  [09:34]
<pjotrp> maybe. I did not get archive to update profiles properly  [09:37]
<pjotrp> Also it is good that they get to understand guix
         this way
<pjotrp> carved in stone, eh  [09:38]
<user02> Yeah, all good  [09:39]
<user02> My mistake was skipping the guix archive part
<user02> Can we begin with the install?
<user02> It's telling me of derivatives that will be downloaded  [09:40]
<user02> So we're good
<user02> Here goes
<pjotrp> yeeha  [09:42]
<user02> pjotrp, where is this guix.genenetwork.org located at?
<pjotrp> Tennessee
<user02> It's...it's....sloooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww
<pjotrp> not from Europe
<pjotrp> is it downloading at all?
<user02> It should be extended
<user02> Yes...like at 100KB/s  [09:43]
<user02> tear-jerker
<user02> Verizon problems
<user02> who's the host?
<pjotrp> I am getting 500Kb/s
<pjotrp> UT
<user02> Guix's servers can run off more than one server, right?
<user02> I'd like to host that particular server here
<user02> For speed
<pjotrp> yes
<user02> Sooner or later
<user02> It will be a necessity  [09:45]
<pjotrp> exactly what I am doing - this is our server
<pjotrp> guix.genenetwork.org:8080
<user02> All done installing  [09:46]
<pjotrp> what?
<user02> Now the databases
<pjotrp> what do you mean by slow exactly?
<user02> Yes, it's installed
<pjotrp> can you run genenetwork2
<user02> setting variables
<user02> If I try running it now, it will fail as I don't have the DBs  [09:47]
<pjotrp> cool - you had a lot of prebuilt packages already
<pjotrp> OK, follow the instructions I wrote above
<user01> now everything seems to be working for me :)
<user02> OK
<pjotrp> user01: excellent!
<pjotrp> you see a webserver?
<user01> yep, can connect to localhost:5003  [09:48]
<pjotrp> So now you are running a guix copy of GN2
<pjotrp> you can see where it lives with `which genenetwork2` or ls -l
         ~/.guix-profile/bin/genenetwork2  [09:49]
<pjotrp>
         /gnu/store/1kma5xszvzsvmbb4k699h7gvdncw901i-genenetwork2-2.0-a8fcff4/bin/genenetwork2
<pjotrp> it is a script
<pjotrp> written by guix, open it  [09:50]
<pjotrp> inside it points to paths and our script at
<pjotrp>
         /gnu/store/1kma5xszvzsvmbb4k699h7gvdncw901i-genenetwork2-2.0-a8fcff4/bin/.genenetwork2-real
<pjotrp> if you open that you can see how the webserver is started  [09:51]
<pjotrp> next step is to run a recent version of GN2
<user01> okay  [09:52]
<pjotrp> See
         https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/tree/staging/doc#run-your-own-copy-of-gn2
<pjotrp> but do not checkout that genetwork2_diet
<pjotrp> we reverted to the main tree
<pjotrp> clone git@github.com:genenetwork/genenetwork2.git  [09:53]
<pjotrp> instead and checkout the staging branch
<pjotrp> that is effectively my branch  [09:54]
<pjotrp> when that is done you should be able to fire up the webserver from
         there  [09:55]
<pjotrp> using ./bin/genenetwork2
<user02> now installing DBs
<user02> Downloading
<pjotrp> annoyingly the source tree is ~700Mb  [09:56]
<user02> Can it also be done by installing the guix package
         genenetwork2-database-small?
<pjotrp> I changed it in the diet version to 8Mb, but I had to revert
<user01> I need to make my VM bigger...
<pjotrp> user02: not ready  [09:57]
<user02> ok
<pjotrp> user01: sorry
<pjotrp> user01: you could mount a local dir inside the VM for development
<pjotrp> that would allow you to use MAC tools for editing
<pjotrp> just an idea
<user01> yeah, I figure I'll do something like that
<pjotrp> do you use emacs?  [09:58]
<user01> yep
<pjotrp> that can also run on remote files over ssh
<pjotrp> that's an alternative
<pjotrp> kudos for using emacs :), wdyt user03
<user02> 79 minutes to go downloading the db
<pjotrp> user02: sorry about that  [09:59]
<pjotrp> it is 2GB
<user02> user, you can also mount the directory via sshfs
<user02> Mac OSX runs OpenSSH
<pjotrp> user02: sopa
<user02> You can therefore mount a directory outside the VM to the VM via
         sshfs  [10:00]
<pjotrp> yes, 3 options now
<user02> That way, you can set up a VM only for it's logic
<user02> Apps + the OS it runs  [10:01]
<user02> For data, let it reside on physical host accessible via sshfs
<user02> Use this Arch wiki reference:
         https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSHFS
<user02> I edited that last somewhere in 2015, may have been updated since
         then
<user01> alright, cool!  [10:04]
<pjotrp> user01: you are almost done  [10:06]
<pjotrp> I wrote an elixir package for guix :)
<pjotrp> env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics/ ./pre-inst-env guix
         package -A elixir
         --substitute-urls="http://guix.genenetwork.org"   [10:08]
<pjotrp> elixir  1.2.3   out
         ../guix-bioinformatics/gn/packages/elixir.scm:31:2
<pjotrp>
<pjotrp> I am building it on guix.genenetwork.org right now  [10:09]
<user01> nice  [10:10]
